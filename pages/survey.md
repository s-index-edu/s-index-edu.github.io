4. **Conference Ranking Systems**
    - **Question:** Which conference ranking systems (e.g., CORE, Microsoft Academic, etc.) do you find most accurately capture a conference's quality and impact? Why?
    - **Responses:**

      | Response | Count |
      |----------|-------|
      | None     | 4     |
      | Don’t know | 2 |
      | I don't follow the rankings closely; I think one's personal experience and word of mouth are more accurate. | 1 |
      | Not sure | 1 |
      | I don't pay much attention to these. | 2 |
      | CORE is somewhat reliable, but all have their flaws. | 1 |
      | CORE, because it is widely recognized in my field. | 1 |
      | Google Scholar Metrics; it includes citation counts which I find useful. | 1 |
      | I don’t rely on them; I go by the reputation within the community. | 1 |
      | CORE, but I have reservations about all ranking systems. | 1 |
      | Microsoft Academic, due to its comprehensive data. | 1 |
      | CORE, based on personal experience. | 1 |
      | I don't use any specific ranking system. | 1 |
      | CORE, as it is well-respected in my field. | 1 |
      | I think they all have biases; none are completely reliable. | 1 |
      | CORE, but it’s not perfect. | 1 |
      | Google Scholar Metrics; it provides a broader perspective. | 1 |
      | I don't follow rankings closely; personal and peer opinions matter more to me. | 1 |
    
#### Detailed Response Analysis

**1. Consideration of Conference Ranking:**
The vast majority of respondents value conference rankings highly, indicating that ranking plays a significant role in their decision-making process for where to submit their work.

**2. Top-Tier Conferences:**
There is a clear preference for specific conferences within different subfields of CS, highlighting the perceived quality and impact of these conferences:
- **Algorithms & Theory**: SIGKDD, ICDM, pVLDB, ICDE, SODA, ESA, STOC, FOCS, WADS, ICALP, STACS, ITCS, CCC.
- **AI**: STOC, FOCS, SODA, CCC, COLT, ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, KDD.
- **Computer Vision**: ICCV, ECCV, CVPR, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, TOG.
- **Networks**: SIGCOMM, NSDI, SOSP, OSDI, INFOCOM, CoNEXT, MobiCom.
- **Databases**: VLDB, SIGMOD, ICDE, PODS, CIKM, EDBT.

**3. Importance of Diversity and Geographical Distribution:**
Opinions are varied, with a significant number of respondents recognizing the importance of diversity and geographical distribution in conference evaluations. However, some respondents do not prioritize these factors, indicating that while important, these are not universally critical for all researchers.

**4. Conference Ranking Systems:**
There is a general indifference or lack of knowledge about specific conference ranking systems. Many respondents do not rely on these systems to determine the quality and impact of conferences, preferring personal experience, peer opinions, and reputation within the community. Among those who do use ranking systems, CORE and Google Scholar Metrics are mentioned as relatively reliable, despite some reservations about their biases.

#### Conclusion
The survey responses provide valuable insights into the preferences and evaluation criteria of researchers in the CS field regarding conferences. The importance of conference ranking, the recognition of top-tier conferences in various subfields, and the varied opinions on diversity and ranking systems reflect the multifaceted considerations researchers take into account when selecting conferences for their submissions. This detailed report can help understand trends and preferences in the academic community, guiding future decisions on conference organization and ranking methodologies.
