                <p>
                    For a conference, we calculate the number of papers each author has published in that conference
                    since its inception. The S-Index is the largest number k such that at least k authors have each
                    published at least k papers in the conference.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Next, we define the "S-Index set" of a conference with an S-Index of k as the set of authors with at
                    least k publications in that conference. The size of the S-Index set can exceed k.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we define the "S-i-Index" of a conference as the number of authors who have published
                    at least i papers in that conference.
                </p>
